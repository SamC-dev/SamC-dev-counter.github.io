<h2> HOW I REALIZED IT </h2>
I used three documents:
<ul>
<li> One for the html </li>
<li> One for javascript </li>
<li> the last one for css for styiling it a little bit </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4> The application works with Javascript, in which there is the most important part of the code.
<br>
I created the interface (buttons,display) in html, taking and changing them in js with DOM properties,
<br>
then I used addEventListener for the click event; I prefer this way to keep html and javascript as separate as possible. </h4>
